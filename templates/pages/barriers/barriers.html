                    <h3>Communication</h3>
                    <p class="txt1">
                        Adults with learning disabilities may find it difficult to communicate their needs and wishes. 
                        This does not mean that they do not have a preference. It should not be assumed that people with 
                        learning disabilities cannot make decisions for themselves. Access to advocate services can support 
                        individuals to do this more confidently.
                    </p>
                    <p class="txt2">
                        People who are living with learning disabilities may benefit from face-to-face support, rather than 
                        over the phone or email. Face-to-face communication is less likely to be misinterpreted by a service 
                        provider or a service user. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Mental Health Difficulties</h3>
                    <p class="txt3">People with learning disabilities are more likely to experience mental health conditions 
                        or disorders. Poor mental health can make someone more vulnerable to domestic abuse and also less 
                        likely to leave someone who is causing them harm. </p>
                    <h3>Social Attitudes</h3>
                    <p class="txt4">Learning difficulties are often ‘invisible’ so people are less likely to recognise that 
                        someone needs additional help or support. Adults with learning difficulties are less likely to receive 
                        education around safe sex and healthy relationships, which leaves them more vulnerable to spotting 
                        the signs of domestic abuse.</p>
