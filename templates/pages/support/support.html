                    <p class="txt1">
                        It has been estimated that 1,043,449 people in England (2% of the population) have a learning disability.
                         The numbers known to learning disability services are much smaller: an estimated 236,235 people.

                    <p class="txt2">
                        People with learning disabilities do not learn certain skills as quickly as other people and may therefore 
                        need extra help in certain aspects of their lives. The specific skills in question will depend upon the type 
                        of disability. People with mild learning disabilities may live alone, travel independently, and work. People 
                        with learning difficulties have the same right to access healthcare as all other people. However, due to a 
                        number of factors, patients with learning disabilities find it far harder to access healthcare and therefore 
                        suffer the consequences, including earlier death and poor long-term condition management, as identified by Sir 
                        Jonathan Michael in his public inquiry into accessing healthcare for those with learning difficulties. As a 
                        health professional, you should actively promote the rights of those with learning difficulties and help them 
                        to overcome the issues they face in accessing healthcare. Depending on the situation, this may take many forms, 
                        but could include: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-el">Supporting them in phoning the GP surgery to make an appointment. </li>
                        <li class="list-el">Arranging for a friend or relative to escort them to a hospital visit. </li>
                        <li class="list-el">Helping them to plan their journey to visit their local GP surgery.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="txt3">
                        They may not require any support from their local authority, or may just need support in managing their finances. 
                        Other people may require more regular support to ensure their safety and health on a daily basis. Those with more 
                        severe or complex needs may need extensive, hour-to-hour help in performing basic skills, such as eating, dressing 
                        and washing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="txt4">
                        With the right support people can live full and meaningful lives. However, if this support is not provided they may 
                        face problems in gaining independence or a home of their own, in accessing leisure and recreation activities, and/or 
                        in developing friendships and relationships.
